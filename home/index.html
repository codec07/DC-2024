        <h1>Briefing & How it Works</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The modern Olympic Games are the world's leading international
            sporting events. We feature summer and winter sports competitions in
            which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a
            variety of competitions
          </li>

          <li>
            The 2024 Summer Olympics,[a] officially the Games of the XXXIII
            Olympiad[b] and branded as Paris 2024, were an international
            multi-sport event held from 26 July to 11 August 2024 in France,
            with several events started from 24 July. Paris was the host city,
            with events (mainly football) held in 16 additional cities spread
            across metropolitan France, including the sailing centre in the
            second-largest city of France, Marseille, on the Mediterranean Sea,
            as well as one subsite for surfing in Tahiti, French Polynesia.
          </li>

          <li>
            Paris was awarded the Games at the 131st IOC Session in Lima, Peru,
            on 13 September 2017. After multiple withdrawals that left only
            Paris and Los Angeles in contention, the International Olympic
            Committee (IOC) approved a process to concurrently award the 2024
            and 2028 Summer Olympics to the two remaining candidate cities; both
            bids of the bids were praised for their high technical plans and
            innovative ways to use a record-breaking number of existing and
            temporary facilities.
          </li>

          <li>
            Having previously hosted in 1900 and 1924, Paris became the second
            city ever to host the Summer Olympics three times (after London,
            which hosted the games in 1908, 1948, and 2012).
          </li>

          <li>
            Paris 2024 was the first Olympics in history to reach full gender
            parity on the field of play, with equal numbers of male and female
            athletes.[12] The United States topped the overall medal table for
            the fourth consecutive Summer Games and 19th time overall, with 40
            gold and 126 total medals.
          </li>

          <li>
            China tied with the United States on golds (40), but finished second
            due to having fewer silvers; the nation won 91 medals overall. Japan
            finished third with 20 gold medals and sixth in the overall medal
            count.
          </li>

          <li>
            The Olympic Movement consists of international sports federations
            (IFs), National Olympic Committees (NOCs), and organising committees
            for each specific Olympic Games
          </li>

          <li>
            As the decision-making body, the IOC is responsible for choosing the
            host city for each Games, and organises and funds the Games
            according to the Olympic Charter.
          </li>

          <li>
            The IOC also determines the Olympic programme, consisting of the
            sports to be contested at the Games.
          </li>

          <li>
            There are several Olympic rituals and symbols, such as the Olympic
            flag, torch, and opening and closing ceremonies. Over 14,000
            athletes competed at the 2020 Summer Olympics and 2022 Winter
            Olympics combined, in 40 different sports and 448 events.
          </li>

          <li>
            The first-, second-, and third-place finishers in each event receive
            Olympic medals: gold, silver, and bronze, respectively.
          </li>

          <li>
            The Games have grown to the point that nearly every nation is now
            represented; colonies and overseas territories are often allowed to
            field their own teams. Every two years, the Olympics and its media
            exposure provide athletes with the chance to attain national and
            international fame.

        <h1>Host Selection</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Having previously hosted the 1900 and 1924 Games, Paris did not
            attempt to host the Olympics again until it bid, unsuccessfully, for
            the 1992 Games which were awarded to Barcelona. Subsequent bids for
            the 2008 and 2012 Games were also unsuccessful, as they were awarded
            to Beijing and London, respectively. Undeterred, Paris decided to
            bid once more for the 2024 edition, which would mark the centenary
            of its last Games.
          </li>

          <li>
            The six candidate cities were Paris, Hamburg, Boston, Budapest,
            Rome, and Los Angeles. The bidding process was slowed by
            withdrawals, political uncertainty, and rising costs. Boston
            surpassed Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington, DC, for the
            official U.S. bid.
          </li>

          <li>
            On 27 July 2015, Boston and the USOC mutually agreed to terminate
            Boston's bid to host the Games, partly because of mixed feelings
            among city residents. Hamburg withdrew its bid on 29 November 2015
            after holding a referendum.[14] Rome withdrew on 21 September 2016,
            citing fiscal difficulties.[15] Budapest withdrew on 22 February
            2017, after a petition against the bid collected more signatures
            than necessary for a referendum.
          </li>

          <li>
            Following these withdrawals, the IOC Executive Board met on 9 June
            2017 in Lausanne, Switzerland, to discuss the 2024 and 2028 bid
            processes.[19][20] The International Olympic Committee formally
            proposed electing the 2024 and 2028 Olympic host cities at the same
            time, a proposal which an Extraordinary IOC Session approved on 11
            July 2017 in Lausanne.
          </li>

          <li>
            The IOC set up a process whereby the LA 2024 and Paris 2024 bid
            committees met with the IOC to discuss which city would host the
            Games in 2024 and 2028 and whether it was possible to select the
            host cities for both at the same time.
          </li>

          <li>
            Following the decision to award the two Games simultaneously, Paris
            was understood to be the preferred host for 2024. On 31 July 2017,
            the IOC announced Los Angeles as the sole candidate for
            2028,[22][23] enabling Paris to be confirmed as host for 2024. Both
            decisions were ratified at the 131st IOC Session on 13 September
            2017.

          <li>
            The President of the Paris 2024 Olympic Organizing Committee, Tony
            Estanguet, unveiled the Olympic and Paralympic medals for the Games
            in February 2024, which on the obverse featured embedded
            hexagon-shaped tokens of scrap iron that had been taken from the
            original construction of the Eiffel Tower, with the logo of the
            Games engraved into it.
          </li>

          <li>
            Approximately 5,084 medals would be produced by the French mint
            Monnaie de Paris, and were designed by Chaumet, a luxury jewellery
            firm based in Paris.
          </li>

          <li>
            The reverse of the medals features Nike, the Greek goddess of
            victory, inside the Panathenaic Stadium which hosted the first
            modern Olympics in 1896. Parthenon and the Eiffel Tower can also be
            seen in the background on both sides of the medal.
          </li>

          <li>
            Each medal weighs 455-529 g (16-19 oz), has a diameter of 85 mm (3.3
            in) and is 9.2 mm (0.36 in) thick.[42] The gold medals are made with
            98.8 percent silver and 1.13 percent gold, while the bronze medals
            are made up with copper, zinc, and tin.
